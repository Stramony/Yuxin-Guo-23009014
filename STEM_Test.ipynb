    "I created a visual motion effect using Python and OpenCV to achieve basic animation and colour effects. I drew grid squares and used the list method to give each box a different colour change (frame) and a smooth transition of colours over time (using colour interpolation); for the RGB values, the difference between the target colour and the current colour was applied to each of their values and multiplied by the speed of change to achieve a smooth transition. I gave a range of random colour variations to keep the colours aesthetically pleasing."
